# What is anulandgames
This is a front end for a database of video games that I own. It uses a sql postgres database in the back end and builds an attractive, material design front end that's easily navigable and makes it simple to add, remove or update the status of any game. All of this is done in docker containers.
# Why build this
This is a passion project of mine, and a learning exercise. I wanted to build a sql database for my games and an attractive front end for it, mainly for the purpose of learning sql and get experience with vibe coding. This is also my first time using git and GitHub. 
# Build
Anulandgames comes in three parts:
### Tables and data
The csv files needed to build the database is included in the tables_template file or you can get my own csv from csv_true and fill them in as needed. There are six tables in total.
### The Database
Before we can enter all the tables into a database, we need to create a postgres container for docker. Check the database folder for the full readme on how to create the docker containers, add the csv files into the database and check the data using the built in web GUI in adminer.
